Privacy Policy for Pocket8

Last Updated: December 27, 2025

Pocket8 is built on a "Privacy First" philosophy. Because the app is a local runner for PICO-8 cartridges, we believe your data should stay exactly where it belongs: on your device.

1. No Data Collection

Pocket8 does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information. We do not have accounts, we do not use trackers, and we do not have a central server that sees your activity.

2. Local Storage Only

All of your game saves, library metadata, and imported cartridges are stored locally on your device using the iOS Filesystem. This data is never uploaded to us or any third party.

3. Third-Party Services (BBS)

When you use the integrated BBS Explorer, the app fetches game data directly from Lexaloffle.com. Pocket8 does not sit in the middle of this connection or log which games you browse or download.

4. No Ads or Analytics

There are no advertisements or analytics SDKs in Pocket8. We don't track how long you play or what games you enjoy.

5. Contact

If you have any questions about this policy, you can reach out via a GitHub Issue on this repository.
